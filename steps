serial steps to install hadoop:
Step one installation :
	1- install java you have to install JDK in java (the best version is 8 ):
		a. link  JDK java -> https://www.oracle.com/eg/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows
		b. create a folder called java in local disk C 
		c. then setup the jdk that you installed setup it in the neew folder it's called java 
		d. delete folder java from program files from local desk C

	2- install apache hadoop:
		a. download hadoop from this link https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
		b. extract folder hadoop to local disk C and then called this folder hadoop
		c. delete folder bin in hadoop 
		e. put this bin in this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nCN_jK7EJF2DmPUUxgOggnvJ6k6tksYz/view in hadoop 
		

step two create enviroment variables for (hadoop - java) :
	1- open system enviroment variables from search bar
	2- click on enviroment variables 
	3- click on new that down user variables 
	4- write in variable name HADOOP_HOME and in variable value the path for hadoop bin i think is C:\hadoop\bin because we put it in C  click ok
	5- write in variable name JAVA_HOME and in variable value the path for java bin i think is C:\java\jdk-1.8\bin because we put it in C click ok
	6- click on path that in system variables then click on edit 
	7- click on new and then write the path for hadoop bin and hadoop sbin and java  jdk bin 
		the path must be -> C:\hadoop\bin     / C:\hadoop\sbin      / C:\java\jdk-1.8\bin 
	8- click ok in every step you made it and close the enviroment
	9- select hadoop-env.cmd from C:\hadoop\etc\hadoop
		open edit and search on line tha have set JAVA_HOME=
		make this line set JAVA_HOME=C:\java\jdk-1.8

step three make sure that Hadoop and Java are in their path on the device:
	1- open cmd 
	2- write hadoop -version 
		you will have:
			java version "1.8.0_431"
			Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_431-b10)
			Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.431-b10, mixed mode)
	3- write java -version 
		you will have:
			java version "1.8.0_431"
			Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_431-b10)
			Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.431-b10, mixed mode)


step four edit the config for some files in hadoop:
	1- open hadoop from etc in hadoop the path will be C:\hadoop\etc\hadoop
	2- edit the files called (core-site.xml / hdfs-site.xml / mapred-site.xml / yarn-site.xml) 
	3- write the next codes in tha files between <property> </property>
		# For core-site.xml
			<property>
			  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
			  <value>hdfs://localhost:9000</value>
			</property>
		
		# For hdfs-site.xml or https-site.xml
			<property>
			  <name>dfs.replication</name>
			  <value>1</value>
			</property><property>
			  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
			  <value>C:\hadoop\data\namenode</value>
			</property><property>
			  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
			  <value>C:\hadoop\data\datanode</value>
			</property>
			
		# For mapred-site.xml
			<property>
			  <name>mapreduce.framework.name</name>
			  <value>yarn</value>
			</property>
		
		# For yarn-site.xml
			<property>
			  <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services</name>
			  <value>mapreduce_shuffle</value>
			</property><property>
			  <name>yarn.nodemanager.auxservices.mapreduce.shuffle.class</name>
			  <value>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ShuffleHandler</value>
			</property>

step five install some tools to avoid problems:
	1- install MSVCR120.DLL from this link https://www.dll-files.com/msvcr120.dll.html
		a. extract that in system 32 in local disk C 
	2- install microsoft visual c++ from this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170


step six some commands in cmd to start the program :
	1- open the cmd 
	2- write hdfs namenode -format 
	3- write cd hadoop
	4- write cd sbin 
	5- write start-dfs.cmd
		a. you will have two terminals and gui window to allow java click on check box that hae public networks (don't close the 2 terminals
	6- write jps in cmd to check namenode and datanode
	7- write start-yarn.cmd you will have two terminals don't close it 
	8- write jps in cmd to check namenode and datanode and resource manager 
	9- search in your browrser about http://localhost:9870/
		a. congratulations  then you will have hadoop
